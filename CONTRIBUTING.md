# Contributing to Relia OSS

First off, thanks for taking the time to improve Relia OSS! We welcome all contributionsâ€”be it bug reports, new features, documentation tweaks, or community support. By participating, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:davidahmann/relia.git
   cd relia-oss
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-cool-feature
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   - Python & CLI:
     ```bash
     poetry install    # or venv + pip install -e .
     ```
   - Extension:
     ```bash
     cd extension && npm install
     ```
5. **Make your changes.** Follow the coding standards below.
6. **Add tests** covering new behavior:
   - Python tests under `tests/` with pytest.
   - Extension tests under `extension/tests/` with ts-node and @vscode/test-electron.
7. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   # From repo root
   pytest

   # In extension/
   npm test
   ```
8. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: describe your change"
   git push origin feature/my-cool-feature
   ```
9. **Open a Pull Request** against `main`. Use the PR template and link any related issues.

## Branch & PR Workflow

- Target branch: `main` (short-lived feature branches).
- PR titles: `<type>(<scope>): <short description>` (e.g. `fix(cli): handle network timeouts`).
- Describe _why_ the change is needed, not just _what_ changed.
- After review, squash-merge with a descriptive commit message.

## Plugin & Schema Contributions

Relia OSS supports drop-in plugins for custom Ansible schemas:
1. Add your `{module_name}.json` file under `backend/plugins/`.
2. Ensure it adheres to the existing schema structure (see `backend/schemas/`).
3. Include a Molecule scenario under `starter/` if your plugin requires testing.
4. Update docs or add a new sample in `starter/`.

## Coding Standards

- **Python**:
  - Follow PEP8. Use `black .` and `ruff .` before committing.
- **TypeScript**:
  - Follow our `tsconfig.json` and ESLint rules. Run `npm run build`.
- **Markdown**:
  - Wrap lines at ~80 characters. Use headings and lists to structure content.

## Reporting Issues

Please use the issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:
- **Bug report**: fill in reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior.
- **Feature request**: describe the use case and why it matters.

## Community & Support

- Join GitHub Discussions for general Q&A.
- For private or enterprise support, contact your vendor or consul.

## Thank You

Your contributions make Relia OSS better for everyone. We appreciate your help! You rock. ðŸŽ‰
